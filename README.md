# NY Covid Charts (Mid-Hudson Region)

[Live Site](https://covid.seandickinson.dev)

The goal of this project is to provide a live dashboard with useful metrics related to COVID cases in NY. The project currently is focused on the Mid-Hudson Valley region and its included counties.

All data for this site is pulled directly from the NY Department of Health directly and is only updated when they have updated their database (once a day).

Note that NY test data uses the date the test is processed rather than the date the test was taken. Thus this data will lag slightly behind active case data and processing times will likely increase as the number of tests does. 

## Current Charts 
- Daily New Positive Cases
- 7 Day Avg. of Cases per 10k
- Daily Percent Positive
- 7 Day Positive Avg.

## Features under consideration
- Expansion to include all NY Regions and Counties
- Sign up for alerts
- Color coded system for risk
