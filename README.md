# NY Covid Charts

[Live Site](https://covid.seandickinson.dev)

The goal of this project is to provide a live dashboard with useful metrics related to COVID cases in NY. Specifically this dashboard provide collated data for each region of New York as well as specific counties. The data provided always reflects the past 2 weeks.

All data for this site is pulled directly from the NY Department of Health directly and is only updated when they have updated their database (once a day).

Note that NY test data uses the date the test is processed rather than the date the test was taken. Thus this data will lag slightly behind active case data and processing times will likely increase as the number of tests does.
